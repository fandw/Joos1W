CS 444/644 - Compiler Construction (Winter 2017) - Assignment 3
</h1>

<!-- <font color=red>Corrections since the assignment was posted are in red.</font> -->
<p>
For the third assignment, you will implement disambiguation of names and
type checking.
<p>
As in Assignment 2,
you must hand in to Marmoset a <tt>.zip</tt> archive containing
your source code. The <tt>.zip</tt> file must contain a file called
<tt>Makefile</tt>. Marmoset will run <tt>make</tt> on this <tt>Makefile</tt>
to compile your compiler. The <tt>Makefile</tt> must generate an executable
(binary or shell script) called <tt>joosc</tt>.
The <tt>joosc</tt> executable must accept multiple
filenames as arguments. All of the files listed on the <tt>joosc</tt>
command line, and <b>only</b> those files, are considered part of
the program being compiled.
<p>
Unlike <tt>javac</tt> and unlike the dOvs version of Joos, your <tt>joosc</tt>
compiler should not look for classes in <tt>.class</tt> files on the
<tt>CLASSPATH</tt>; it should read <b>only</b> the Joos 1W source files
listed on the command line. This means that all classes, including
classes such as <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>, must be available in
source form and must be specified on the <tt>joosc</tt> command line.
Unlike <tt>javac</tt>, Joos does not care what directory a source
file is in (i.e. it does not require the directory structure
of the source code to match the package structure).
However, the class declared in a file must still have the same name
as the filename.
For example, Java would require that the class <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>
be declared in the file <tt>Object.java</tt> in the directory
<tt>java.lang</tt>, whereas Joos only requires the file to
be named <tt>Object.java</tt>, but otherwise allows it to
be in any directory.
<p>
For the purposes of this course, a minimalist version of the
Java standard library is provided. This library can be found
in the <tt>linux.student.cs</tt> environment in the directory
<tt>/u/cs444/pub/stdlib/3.0</tt>. Marmoset will include all
files in this library on the <tt>joosc</tt> command line for
every test, in addition to other source file(s) specific to that
test. The following versioning scheme is used to make it possible
to correct errors and/or to extend the library for future assignments
(although we aim to minimize the number of changes that will be required).
The 3 in the directory name refers to Assignment 3, and the 0
is the first version of the library. Any corrections to the Assignment 3
version of the library will appear in the directories <tt>3.1</tt>,
<tt>3.2</tt>, etc., and the version of the library for Assignment 4
will appear in the directory <tt>4.0</tt>.
<p>
Version 3.0 of the standard library is identical to version 2.0.
<p>
As in previous assignments,
<tt>joosc</tt> should process the Joos 1W files given on the command line,
produce appropriate diagnostic messages on standard error,
and exit with one of the following Unix return codes:
<ul>
    <li>0: the input file is valid Joos 1W
    <li>42: the input file is <b>not</b> valid Joos 1W
    <li>any other value: your compiler crashed
</ul>
<p>
The Marmoset tests for this assignment take several minutes to run.
Do not submit more than one submission at a time to Marmoset.
If Marmoset reports that your previous submission has not been tested
yet, do not submit another one. Denial-of-service attacks on Marmoset
will result in disciplinary action.
<p>
You are not required to submit a design document for this assignment.
However, Assignment 4 will require a design document covering
your design decisions for Assignments 2, 3, and 4, so it is
recommended that you start writing such a document.
As for Assignment 1,
the document should be
organized to enable someone unfamiliar with your code to understand the
structure of your compiler. In the document, discuss
challenges that you encountered and how you tried to overcome them in
your design and implementation. Also explain the testing that you
did before submitting to Marmoset.

<h2>Disambiguation and Linking of Names</h2>

The disambiguation stage determines the meaning of each remaining use
of a name, and links the use to the declaration of the
entity (field, method, local variable, formal parameter, or type)
that the name refers to. Disambiguation of syntactically ambiguous names is
specified in Section 6.5.2 of the Java Language Specification
and was discussed in class.
<p>
Note that Joos 1W supports a simplified version of method overloading
compared to the full Java overloading rules detailed in Section 15.12.2
of the Java Language Specification. Although Joos 1W does allow
method overloading (i.e. multiple methods with the same name,
but different parameter types),
the declared types of the parameters must exactly match
the static types of the argument expressions in order for the
method to be called. For example, a call such as <tt>bar('x')</tt>
will not invoke a method with signature <tt>bar(int)</tt>,
as it would in Java, but the call <tt>bar((int)'x')</tt> would.
<p>
If a prefix of a name refers to a variable or field, then
the remaining part of the name refers to non-static field(s)
or a method of the object referred to by that variable or field.
At this stage, non-static fields and methods are not resolved;
this is deferred until the type checking stage, when the
static type of the base variable or field is known.
<p>
During and/or after disambiguation of names, the following restrictions
of the Joos 1W language must be checked:
<ul>
    <li>Check that all names (except non-static field and method
    accesses) can be disambiguated. It is an
    error if a name cannot be linked to any entity that is in scope at the
    point where the name is used.
    <li>Check the rules specified in Section 8.3.2.3 of the Java Language
    Specification regarding forward references. The initializer of a
    non-static field must not use (i.e. read) by simple name
    (i.e. without an explicit <tt>this</tt>) itself or a non-static
    field declared later in the same class.
</ul>

<h2>Type Checking</h2>

The type checking stage determines the types of all expressions
and subexpressions, checks that they conform to the Joos 1W
typing rules, and links all remaining names (i.e. non-static
field accesses and method calls) to the declarations that they
refer to.
<p>
It is possible for a class to contain multiple methods with the
same signature, all abstract, and all inherited from one of its
superclasses. In this case, the method call may be linked to
any one of these methods, since they are guaranteed to have the
same return type.
<p>
During and/or after type checking, the following restrictions
of the Joos 1W language must be checked:
<ul>
    <li>Check that the types of all expressions and subexpressions
    conform to the Joos 1W typing rules, and that all statements
    are type-correct. The Joos 1W typing rules are the same as the
    Java typing rules with the following exceptions:
    <ul>
        <li>Assignability is the same as in Java (see Section 5.2
        of the Java Language Specification), except that
        narrowing conversions are never allowed.
        <li>In a cast to a reference type <tt>T</tt> and in an
        <tt>instanceof</tt> expression comparing to reference type <tt>T</tt>,
        the type of the subexpression <tt>S</tt> must be such that
        <tt>S</tt> is assignable to <tt>T</tt> or <tt>T</tt>
        is assignable to <tt>S</tt>. This is a simplification
        of the rules specified in Section 5.5 of the Java Language
        Specification. The rules for casts to primitive types
        are the same as in Java.
    </ul>
    <li>Check that all non-static field and method uses can
    be resolved to fields and methods that exist.
    <li>Check that fields/methods accessed as static are actually
    static, and that fields/methods accessed as non-static are actually
    non-static.
    <li>Check that all accesses of protected fields, methods and constructors
    are in a subtype of the type declaring the entity being accessed,
    or in the same package as that type.
    <li>Check that the name of a constructor is the same as the name of
    its enclosing class.
    <li>A constructor in a class other than <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>
    implicitly calls the zero-argument constructor of its superclass.
    Check that this zero-argument constructor exists.
    <li>Check that no objects of abstract classes are created.
    <li>Check that no bitwise operations occur.
    <li>Check that the implicit <tt>this</tt> variable is not accessed
    in a static method or in the initializer of a static field.
</ul>
