CS 444/644 - Compiler Construction (Winter 2017) - Assignment 4
</h1>

<p>
For the fourth assignment, you will implement static reachability analysis,
and check that all variables have an initializer.
<p>
As in previous assignments,
you must hand in to Marmoset a <tt>.zip</tt> archive containing
your source code. The <tt>.zip</tt> file must contain a file called
<tt>Makefile</tt>. Marmoset will run <tt>make</tt> on this <tt>Makefile</tt>
to compile your compiler. The <tt>Makefile</tt> must generate an executable
(binary or shell script) called <tt>joosc</tt>.
The <tt>joosc</tt> executable must accept multiple
filenames as arguments. All of the files listed on the <tt>joosc</tt>
command line, and <b>only</b> those files, are considered part of
the program being compiled.
<p>
Unlike <tt>javac</tt> and unlike the dOvs version of Joos, your <tt>joosc</tt>
compiler should not look for classes in <tt>.class</tt> files on the
<tt>CLASSPATH</tt>; it should read <b>only</b> the Joos 1W source files
listed on the command line. This means that all classes, including
classes such as <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>, must be available in
source form and must be specified on the <tt>joosc</tt> command line.
Unlike <tt>javac</tt>, Joos does not care what directory a source
file is in (i.e. it does not require the directory structure
of the source code to match the package structure).
However, the class declared in a file must still have the same name
as the filename.
For example, Java would require that the class <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>
be declared in the file <tt>Object.java</tt> in the directory
<tt>java.lang</tt>, whereas Joos only requires the file to
be named <tt>Object.java</tt>, but otherwise allows it to
be in any directory.
<p>
For the purposes of this course, a minimalist version of the
Java standard library is provided. This library can be found
in the <tt>linux.student.cs</tt> environment in the directory
<tt>/u/cs444/pub/stdlib/4.0</tt>. Marmoset will include all
files in this library on the <tt>joosc</tt> command line for
every test, in addition to other source file(s) specific to that
test. The following versioning scheme is used to make it possible
to correct errors and/or to extend the library for future assignments
(although we aim to minimize the number of changes that will be required).
The 4 in the directory name refers to Assignment 4, and the 0
is the first version of the library. Any corrections to the Assignment 4
version of the library will appear in the directories <tt>4.1</tt>,
<tt>4.2</tt>, etc., and the version of the library for Assignment 5
will appear in the directory <tt>5.0</tt>.
<p>
Version 4.0 of the standard library is identical to version 3.0.
<p>
As in previous assignments,
<tt>joosc</tt> should process the Joos 1W files given on the command line,
produce appropriate diagnostic messages on standard error,
and exit with one of the following Unix return codes:
<ul>
    <li>0: the input file is valid Joos 1W
    <li>42: the input file is <b>not</b> valid Joos 1W
    <li>any other value: your compiler crashed
</ul>
<p>
The Marmoset tests for this assignment take several minutes to run.
Do not submit more than one submission at a time to Marmoset.
If Marmoset reports that your previous submission has not been tested
yet, do not submit another one. Denial-of-service attacks on Marmoset
will result in disciplinary action.
<p>
Submit to Marmoset a PDF document of no more than six pages explaining
the design decisions you made in completing
Assignments 2, 3, and 4.
As for Assignment 1,
the document should be
organized to enable someone unfamiliar with your code to understand the
structure of your compiler. In the document, discuss
challenges that you encountered and how you tried to overcome them in
your design and implementation. Also explain the testing that you
did before submitting to Marmoset.
<p>
The document will be hand-marked, with 2/3 of the marks for
organization, clarity, and style, and 1/3 of the marks for
technical content.
<p>
According to the late policy posted on the course web page,
design documents submitted after the assignment deadline
will not be marked and will receive a mark of <b>zero</b>.
If you cannot finish the
assignment by the deadline, submit what you have by the deadline,
and explain any unfinished parts in your design document.

<h2>Reachability Checking</h2>

This phase must check the following restrictions of the Joos 1W language:
<ul>
    <li>All statements must be reachable. Details of the exact definition
    of reachability are specified in Section 14.20 of the Java Language
    Specification.
    <li>The last statement on every finite-length execution path through a method whose return
    type is not <tt>void</tt> must be a return statement.
    <li>Every local variable must have an initializer, and the variable must
    not occur in its own initializer.
</ul>
